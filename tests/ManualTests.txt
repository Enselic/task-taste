List of bugs we should not introduce, but
that there are no automatic tests for yet:
==========================================

* Plot is updated when tasks are added and removed, and their sizes
  are changed, as well as when the worked-per-week estiamte is changed
* After a named new task has been created, the 'Add task' input field
  is cleared
* When there are no work left, the plot says "Project complete!"
